#About
The basic service that our system provides is - People call on our phone number and ask their query in English or Hindi(this can be any question, generally fact based), once the response is calculated it is sent to their mobile number through SMS. We use various methods to cluster requests into various categories using natural language processing and machine learning and make the query to the right API like Watson, Wolfram Alpha, Duck Duck Go and google maps etc. to get the best answer for the user.
